# TinyTalker
Android application to chat with a locall small LLM using ONNX.

This project was originally adapted from the one available in the [onnxruntime-inference-examples](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime-inference-examples)
repository. In that repository there are different examples of applications (Also Android ones) based
on ONNX models. This application was based on the one available at [this link](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime-inference-examples/tree/main/mobile/examples/phi-3/android).
